# Rise-of-Transfer-Learning

This is the repository for my presentation at the joint Emory University Atlanta Undergraduate Research Mathematics Seminar in November 2022 and also Mathematical Aspects of Data Sciences Meeting, ,jointly organized by Spelman College and Georgia Institute of Technology, in February 2023. You can explore examples of deep learning models, including YOLO, Stable Diffusion, Transformers from HuggingFace, and Whisper, in the "examples.ipynb" file. I strongly encourage you to play with the code and think about exciting projects you can create on your own.


The summary of this repo is ["AI will not replace you. A person using AI will"](https://twitter.com/svpino/status/1610984481342771200?s=20). If you're new to AI or feel overwhelmed by the amount of information to learn, don't worry. The entry point to AI is not as high as you might think, and I believe that transfer learning is a great place to start. To begin, I recommend exploring the [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/), where you can discover how existing AI tools can add value to your work, no matter what your profession is. You'll be pleasantly surprised to find that you can use these tools without needing to write extensive code.


## I want full freedom, I will use Python

Clone this repository and navigate to "Rise-of-Transfer-Learning" folder. First install Conda [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html). Then do the following from your terminal;

step1: create a Conda environment from environment.yml file.
> conda env create -f environment.yml

step2: activate your environment
> conda activate myenv

step3: get YOLO repository
> git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5.git

step4: launch a Jupyter notebook
> jupyter notebook

step5: open "examples.ipynb" file and run the cells! 

## I am just here to look around, give me the browser!

If you dont want to deal with all these Python hussles and just try out these tools in a browser, here are the links. Look around in these websites, you will find amazing models, espcially in OpenAI website. I would be very happy to see your pictures from Stable Diffusion. Shoot me an email at erdikara@spelman.edu, enjoy!
