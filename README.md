# EmoryTalk
"Explore the latest advancements in AI with YOLO, GPT3, Stable Diffusion and Whisper. This repository includes all the material from my talkfrom Emory University's Atlanta Undergraduate Research Mathematics Seminar. See examples of these cutting-edge models in action and try them out yourself."

## I want full freedom, I will use Python

Clone this repository and navigate to "EmoryTalk" folder. First install Conda [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html). Then do the following from your terminal;

step1: create a Conda environment from environment.yml file.
>conda env create -f environment.yml

step2: activate your environment
>conda activate myenv

step3: get YOLO repository
>git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5.git

step4: get Stable Diffusion repo. This will take some time, the repo is around 17GB
> git lfs install
> git clone https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5

step5:For GPT3, you need openai key. Sign up [here](https://beta.openai.com/playground).

step6: launch a Jupyter notebook
> jupyter notebook

step7: open "models.ipynb" file and run the cells! 

Pay special attention to section2,3 and 4. Try out different prompts. Remember, anything that comes out of Stable Diffusion or GPT3 prompts is your property! I included brief notes in the notebook to help you play around.


## I am just here to look around, give me the browser!

If you dont want to deal with all these Python hussles and just try out these tools in a browser, here are the links. Look around in these websites, you will find amazing models, espcially in OpenAI website. I would be very happy to see your pictures from Stable Diffusion. Shoot me an email at erdikara@spelman.edu, enjoy!
